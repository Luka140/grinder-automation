## Nodes
### data_collector
A node that connects to the PLC with grinder, and sends commands to the ACF node. It performs a grind for a requested force, RPM, and contact duration.
Parameters:
- `plc_target_ams`: AMS ID of the PLC.
- `plc_target_ip`: IP address of the PLC.
- `timeout_time`: Maximum time allowed before timeout.
- `time_before_extend`: Time delay before ACF extension to allow the grinder to spin up.
- `rpm_control_var`: Name of variable which controls the RPM through PLC.
- `grinder_on_var`: Name of variable for turning the grinder on/off.
- `grinder_enabled`: Bool that enables or disables the grinder.
- `time_var`: Name of variable for PLC timestamps.
- `max_acf_extension`: Maximum allowed ACF extension.

Topics:
- `/acf/force` [Float32Stamped](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/Float32Stamped.msg): Publishes the force applied during grinding.
- `~/rpm` [Int32Stamped](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/Int32Stamped.msg): Publishes the grinder's actual RPM. Solely for logging purposes.
- `~/requested_rpm` [Int32Stamped](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/Int32Stamped.msg): Publishes the requested RPM. Solely for logging purposes.
- `~/timesync` [TimeSync](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/TimeSync.msg): Publishes time synchronization messages between ROS and PLC.

 - `/acf/telem` [ACFTelemStamped](https://github.com/Luka140/ferrobotics_acf/blob/humble/msg/ACFTelemStamped.msg): Subscribes to ACF telemetry, handling force and position data.

Services:
- `~/execute_test` [TestRequest](https://github.com/Luka140/data_gathering_msgs/blob/main/srv/TestRequest.srv): Starts a test by setting force, RPM, and contact duration. It handles RPM control, ACF engagement, monitoring grinder performance, and managing shutdown sequences on test completion or failure.


### test_coordinator
A node that cycles through the tests specified in the launch file. It coordinates the grinds, scans, volume calculations, and data recording. 

Parameters:
- `force_settings`: list of force settings for the queued tests
- `rpm_settings`: list of RPM settings for the queued tests
- `contact_time_settings`: list of contact time settings for the queued tests
- `grit`: the grit of the sanding belt - for logging purposes
- `sample`: handle/name by which to identify the tests - for logging purposes
- `plate_thickness`: the thickness of the plate in mm. 

- `belt_prime_force`: the force setting at which to prime a new belt
- `belt_prime_rpm`: the RPM setting at which to prime a new belt
- `belt_prime_time`: the time setting at which to prime a new belt
- `initial_prime`: bool to indicate whether a prime run needs to be performed before the first queued test
- `wear_threshold`: the threshold of the belt wear indicator after which the belt needs to be changed

- `data_path`: path to the data storage location
- `wear_tracking_path`: path to the storage location of the belt run history to calculate wear
- `test_tracker_path`: path to file which tracks all tests that have been run
- `record_path`: path to rosbag storage


Topics:
- `user/continue_testing` [Empty]: Send Empty msg to this topic to continue testing when prompted
- `user/changed_belt` [Empty]: Send Empty msg to this topic to confirm you have changed the belt when prompted
  
- `~/test_failure` [String]: Publishes a message indicating that a test has failed and why for logging purposes.
- `~/belt_wear_history` [BeltWearHistory](https://github.com/Luka140/data_gathering_msgs/blob/main/msg/BeltWearHistory.msg): Publishes the belt wear on the currently tracked belt for logging purposes
- `~/grind_area` [GrindArea](https://github.com/Luka140/data_gathering_msgs/blob/main/msg/GrindArea.msg): Publishes the grinder contact area size for logging purposes
- `~/volume`[Float32Stamped](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/Float32Stamped.msg): Publishes the removed volume for logging purposes
    
Clients:
- `execute_loop` [RequestPCL](https://github.com/Luka140/data_gathering_msgs/blob/main/srv/RequestPCL.srv): Requests a scan of the test object
- `calculate_volume_lost` [RequestPCLVolumeDiff](https://github.com/Luka140/data_gathering_msgs/blob/main/srv/RequestPCLVolumeDiff.srv): Requests the comparison of two pointclouds and the calculation of lost volume.
